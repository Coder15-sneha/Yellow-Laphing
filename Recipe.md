Laphing Directions:

Step 1:
 Add the flour in a large bowl and add salt. Knead the flour to prepare dough by mixing water slowly.

Step 2:
Cover the dough for 1-2 hours. Now, uncover the dough. Pour water onto the bowl until the dough is fully covered. Begin mashing the dough with hand until the starch comes out and the gluten separates. Now, filter this mix through a sieve to separate the gluten with water.

Step 3:
Keep aside the milky white water that has remained after the filtering. Let it rest for 6 to 7 hours or overnight.

Step 4:
Now take the gluten that has remained in the sieve. Wash it with clear water for 2 to 3 times until the water comes out clear not creamy. Add a pinch of yeast or baking soda to the gluten now. Mix it well. Then keep this gluten aside for 15 minutes.

Step 5:
Heat the momo steamer. When the water starts to boil, steam the gluten for around 15 minutes. After steaming, chop it into small slices. And set aside. It will be required for our final step only.

Step 6:
Now, back to our milky white water from step 3. By this time, a clear layer of water will have separated on top of the bowl. Slowly pour the clear water onto another bowl by tilting the bowl. It is not necessary to remove all the water. Remove as much clear water as possible. This water is not needed anymore. Stir the remaining batter well so that it has thick consistency.

Step 7:
Now, add a half tablespoon turmeric powder to this mix. You can also add yellow food color. Or any other food color at this step. Mix well. Now, this starch batter now also needs to be steamed.

Step 8:
Add some little oil in a plate or shallow bowl. Pour 1 scoop of the starch batter onto the plate. Heat the momo steamer and bring water to boil. When it is boiling, place the plate with the starch batter inside the steamer. Cover and steam for 2 to 3 minutes. When you see bubbles, it means that it is cooked.

Step 9:
When it’s cooked, take out from steamer. Our laphing is almost done. Now, go ahead and do similar process for the remaining batter. It might be difficult to remove the laphing from the plate so use a cake spatula, knife or thin spoon if the laphing is sticking to the plate. Spread olive oil lightly over one laphing before putting another on top of it to prevent them from sticking to each other. All laping is ready. Transfer them all in plates.

Sauce Directions:

Step 10: Let’s prepare the ingredients first. Roast the sesame seed. Chop garlic into small pieces. Peel and grate the garlic. Squeeze it to take out its juice. Prepare chilli powder. Now, mix all of these in a bowl.

Step 11:
Heat a pan in low flame. Add oil. When it’s hot, add bay leaves, szechuan pepper, dill seed and cinnamon stick. When you begin to smell the aroma of the spices, scopp the spice leaves out. Continue to heat it until the oil becomes slightly smoky. Now, take out the pan and pour this smoking hot oil onto our ingredient mix bowl from above. Cover the bowl properly so that the ingredients boil with the oil and your kitchen is also saved from fuming hot chilli smell. After about 5 minutes, add the vinegar, light and dark soy sauce and mix well. Add salt if the mix is not salty enough for you.

Step 12:
Now, both our sauce and laphing is ready.  Let’s start to make yummy mouthwatering laphing. Simply spread the chilly sauce over the laphing and place the chopped gluten on one side. Roll it.

Step 13:
Take the rolled laughing, place it into a chopping board and cut it into your desired piece size.

Step 14:
At this point, you can also add other stuffing on the laphing. Place cooked laphing over the chopping board, spread chilly sauce, place the gluten on top if you like. Roll it and cut it.

Step 15:
Sprinkle spring onion over the laphing as a finishing touch.
